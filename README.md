*TODO AS OF JUNE13/2023:*
1. Render each component as pages such that URL suffixes change only right bar components (and still allow the menu bar on the left to redirect to a different URL suffix and page)
2. link redirection for each article on the writings page. For example -> ".../reads/1" redirects to the earliest published article, which happens to be on medium and therefore redirects accordingly). Also, ".../linkedin" should redirect to my linkedin domain. stuff like that
