In the peak of Covid, my friends and I started a group notes to keep track of interesting books we've seen online and get recommended that we hope to read. 

A lot of it is a result of rabbitholes and phases each of us dive into over the course of new experiences and readings. We noticed quickly that it's pretty cool to have a sample of other people's minds' wanderings as measured by the books they find interesting at any given time. 

It's sort of a natural but orchestrated discovery process.
